### Auto Change Pet and Mount Randomly

_Maintained by [[User:Benniefolyfe|Benniefolyfe]]_

This script will change your pet and mount randomly. It will not do anything if you have only 1 or 0 pet / mount.
You just need to set your own User ID and API Token first in place of #HabiticaUserID# and #HabiticaAPIToken#, and then set the trigger with the interval you prefer. (I set it to daily change, during the night, so the morning gives me a new surprise).
If you want to change only the pet or only the mount, remove the block of code below the appropriate "randomly change the pet/mount" comment.

* Go to script.google.com. If this is your first script, this will automatically create a new Google script for you and open an editor for it. Otherwise, edit an existing project by clicking the pencil icon next to it, or create another.
* Paste the code snippet below into the editor, replacing the spaces marked #HabiticaUserID# and #HabiticaAPIToken# with [Habitica User ID and API Token]() (leave the quotes). These can be found under the API tab in your Habitica settings.

See script here: 

* If you are interested only to the change of the pet remove the block of code below "randomly change the mount". 
* If you are interested only to the change of the mount remove the block of code below "randomly change the pet.
* Now add a trigger. Under ''Edit'', select ''Current project's triggers''. Then add a trigger that make the script run on your preferred schedule.
